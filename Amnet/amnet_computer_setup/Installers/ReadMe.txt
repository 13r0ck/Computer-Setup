##How to install with the script
*Just because the installer is in the installer folder does not mean that the program will be installed.

*To install the application it must be setup in smart.xml in the config folder. This folder is simply for
organizational purposes. Similarly, using the misc_start/misc_end in the script programs can be downloaded
from the internet, then called with the smart.xml without ever needing to use this folder.

*As well, if a program has dependencies, a sub-folder can be created with all of the contents of the installer.
As long as that new path is referenced in the smart.xml

#Not all installers from the Config\Smart.xml are included in this folder. In your own setup feel free to add wahtever you need
